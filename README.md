# DiscordCleaner
A pyautogui script to delete messages on the Discord client for Windows

# Why?
My close friend was recently victim to an account hijack via a suspicious discord link. I made this script to help delete our mutual friends' message history. Although not entirely effective, this helped prevent further vulnerabilities.
